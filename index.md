## Yoomin Lee

Thank you for visiting my website. I am a **_Junior Profesional Officer_** at **_the World Bank Transport Global Practice_**. 

I have immersed myself in the field of infrastructure, transportation and logistics while developing an operational and financial skill set that can be used to contribute to improved infrastructure for developing nations. Just like various modes of transportation keep people moving, I believe that proper investment and development in transportation is a road that will eventually lead to progress in the fight against poverty.
In my free time, I enjoy painting and writing. I would like to share some of my creative activities with you through this online archieve.
